## Overview

Addressing the problem statement of Customer churn and to provide a granular view on the customers use of services at PhoneNow (Call centre), I have designed and built a interactive dashboard that gives an overview on the demographics of the customers with relevance to the churn rate and a static report relecting on the use of services by the PhoneNow's customers based on the requisites provided by the Retention manager at PhoneNow. (This Power BI dashboard that I have created here was my proposal to the problem statetment provided by PWC as part of their virtual internship program)

## The Creator's view point

- I have always been so very consious about the design of the dashboard, I don't just want it to give insights but I also want to make sure the end user is drwan into the flow of it. This probably could be the fact that I graduated out of a bachelor program which in itself had a lot of focus on the design of machines and elements, I have also loved spending hours on the design software like Solidworks etc, this may be is subconciously driving me to transistion those skills and as a result, I ended up using Figma for designing the background and the frames holding the infographics. Although the output is a bare minimum of what Figma can offer in terms of design, but neverthess I did get started with it.

- The colour schema used in this project closely resembles the palette of colours from the company's logo, I beleive this makes it more brand centric.

- I have designed the dashboard with a primary focus on the demographics of PhoneNow's customers. Since the predominant focus is on customer churn I have used a slicer to clearly show the difference in demographics between the existing customers and customers who have churned.

- I further have created a static report focusing on the use of all the different services by PhoneNow's customers.

## Dataset 

The dataset used in this project contains both demographic information and some data illustrating the relationship between the company and the customers like the tenure, services customers have subscribed to etc. The data is collected by PhoneNow and owned by PhoneNow.

## Key metrics explored

- Demographic info abot customers - gender, age, range and if they have partners and dependents
- Customers churned, Churn rate
- Relationship between customer's tenure with the company and the churn rate
- Services customers have signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support and streaming TV and movies
- Difference in use of services between the existing customers and those who have churned
- Customeer account information: how long as a customer, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
